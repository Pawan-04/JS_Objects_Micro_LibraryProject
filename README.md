This is CUI based Library Project(MINI).
This project is created to just understand the basic flow of objects and classes in java script and to get comfortable with them.

This includes 2 classes one is Library which has 2 functions (addBooks() and listBooks())
addbooks() adds new books into the library
listbooks list the details of all books stored in library

second class is Book ->>> it stores the bookName, author, price, isbn number and ReadStatus of each book.
The class BOOk class has a function to change the ReadStatus (changeStatus() from true to false, by default it is false (shows no one has read this book yet).
It also has a info() functions which prints the all information about each book.
